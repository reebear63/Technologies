**pandas**
pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open-source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.

**numpy**
NumPy is the fundamental package needed for scientific computing with Python. It provides:
- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

**matplotlib**
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animateed, and interactive visualizations in Python.
