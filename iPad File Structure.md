# iPad File Structure #

The iPad has no visible file structure, and any file that you have are accessible only through a compatible app. When you create a file on the iPad, it will be accessible only from the app that you created it with or an app that you send the file to.

## The Files (Dateien) app ##
The Files app is a centralized hub for available cloud-based storage options such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and iCloud Drive. It also contains documents stored on iOS devices that were created in other apps. Previously, the only way to get at these local files was by plugging the iPhone or iPad into your PC and launching iTunes.
