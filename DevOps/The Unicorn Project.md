# Hinweise und Markierungen für "The Unicorn Project" by Gene Kim #

##Part One: September 3–September 18 ## 

### Chapter 1: Wednesday, September 3 ### 
Some developer broke the build when they merged their changes in.

### Chapter 1: Wednesday, September 3 ###
She’s learned over her entire career that when people can’t get their builds going consistently , disaster is usually right around the corner .

### Chapter 1: Wednesday, September 3 ###
Without constant feedback from a centralized build , integration , and test system , they really have no idea what will happen when all their work is merged with everyone else’s .
### Chapter 2: Friday, September 5th ###
 entirely , the knowledge scattered across the entire organization .

### Chapter 2: Friday, September 5th ###
there’s something even more important than code : the systems that enable developers to be productive , so that they can write high - quality code quickly and safely , freeing themselves from all the things that prevent them from solving important business problems .

### Chapter 2: Friday, September 5th ###
Parts Unlimited helps our customers in many ways . We are one of the world’s most admired manufacturing organizations , making the high - quality and affordable parts that our customers need to keep their cars running .

### Chapter 2: Friday, September 5th ###
We will be launching the Phoenix Project later this month . No more delays . No more postponements . ”

### Chapter 2: Friday, September 5th ###
there are over a hundred developers who are nowhere near as productive as they should be ,
### Chapter 2: Friday, September 5th ### 
It was a combination of technical problems and human error , and we think we’ve remedied both of them . ”
### Chapter 3: Monday, September 8 ### 
you don’t find problems quickly , you end up finding them months later .

### Chapter 3: Monday, September 8 ### 
Functional programming is truly a better tool to think with .
### Chapter 3: Monday, September 8 ###
Somehow builds have ceased being a part of everyone’s daily work .
### Chapter 3: Monday, September 8 ### 
build things with focus , flow , and joy . She had fast feedback in her work .
### Chapter 4: Thursday, September 11 ### 
William , the QA director , is in charge of the release team . His goal : get everything into a releasable state and to coordinate with Ops , who were blindsided too .
### Chapter 4: Thursday, September 11 ### 
PMaxine has seen how Dev and Ops interact around Phoenix . Instead of acting like an actual team , they act more like sovereign states on the brink of war , with diplomats trying to patch together an uneasy peace , complete with embassies , protocols , and official formalities . Even scheduling a meeting between these two groups requires a summit and lawyers present .
### Chapter 4: Thursday, September 11 ### 
developers always make sure features take priority , and you never clean up all the technical debt you create … typical crap , ”
### Chapter 4: Thursday, September 11 ### 
And they haven’t defined the production environment that the application needs to run in —
### Chapter 4: Thursday, September 11 ### 
production deployments are some of the most complex activities of any technology organization , because they require so much coordination between so many different parts of the organization .
### Chapter 4: Thursday, September 11 ### 
Redshirts by John Scalzi and Wil Wheaton ,
### Chapter 4: Thursday, September 11 ### 
She is disheartened by how Parts Unlimited executives , the bridge officers , are so disconnected from the daily work of the “ redshirts ” in the technology organization .
### Chapter 4: Thursday, September 11 ### 
She is so close to getting a Phoenix build going !
### Chapter 5: Thursday, September 11 ### 
Kurt laughs , clearly not bothered by the characterization . “ I’m just trying to solve people’s problems . If I’m guilty of anything , it’s that I care too much about the success of Phoenix , and even the whole company , to allow bureaucracy to kill it !
### Chapter 5: Thursday, September 11 ### 
Brent , who has his hands in everything infrastructure related , ”
### Chapter 5: Thursday, September 11 ### 
“ We invite you to be a part of the inner - circle of the ‘ Rebellion . ’
### Chapter 5: Thursday, September 11 ### 
These are people from Dev , QA , Security , and Ops — a very unlikely group of people to be socializing , let alone working together .
### Chapter 5: Thursday, September 11 ### 
“ The PRD ! ” everyone shouts , laughing . Maxine raises her eyebrows . Those made sense decades ago , when you wanted written justification before you wasted a bunch of developers ’ time . But now you can prototype most features in the time it takes to even write one page of a PRD .
### Chapter 5: Thursday, September 11 ### 
We’re QA . We protect the organization from developers .
### Chapter 6: Friday, September 12 ### 
“ All roads lead to Brent . ”
### Chapter 6: Friday, September 12 ### 
all decisions and escalations quickly grind to a standstill , even for emergencies , which Maxine didn’t expect . She discovers why : every
### Chapter 6: Friday, September 12 ### 
By Thursday , things have stabilized substantially . The most glaring defects and performance problems in Phoenix have been fixed .
### Chapter 6: Friday, September 12 ### 
unfair that all the blame is being put on the technology organization , and no one from the business or product side is being held accountable .
### Chapter 6: Friday, September 12 ### 
nce we get continuous builds going , we enable automated testing . We get automated testing , we can make changes quicker , with more confidence , and without having to depend on hundreds of hours of manual testing . And that , I believe , is the critical first step for how we can deliver better value , safer , faster , and happier .
### Chapter 6: Friday, September 12 ### 
Watermelon projects ? Green on the outside , but red on the inside ? That’s what every one of our IT projects is these days , ”
### Chapter 6: Friday, September 12 ### 
“ I’ve been here for fifteen years , and we’ve been playing this game of outsourcing and insourcing IT the whole time .
### Chapter 6: Friday, September 12 ### 
And we’ve lost the capability to do some of even the most basic things ourselves .
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
“ This is Dr . Erik Reid . You may not know this , but Steve and Dick have been trying to recruit him to serve on the board of Parts Unlimited for months . He’s worked with the company for decades . In fact , Erik was part of the initial MRP rollout in the ’ 80s , and then he helped the manufacturing plants adopt Lean principles and practices .
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ###
“ In tightly coupled and complected systems , it’s nearly impossible to change anything , because you can’t just change one area of the code , you must change one hundred , or even a thousand , areas of the code . And even the smallest changes can cause wildly unpredictable effects in distant parts of the system , maybe in something you’ve never even heard of .
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
“ When you put them all on one switch , you complected their value streams , all now having dependencies on each other that didn’t exist before . They must constantly communicate , coordinate , schedule , marshal , sequence , and deconflict their work . They now have an extremely high cost of coordination , which has lengthened lead times , decreased quality , and , in your story , led to a week - long catastrophe that significantly impaired the business , going all the way up to Steve , ” Erik says with glee .
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
“ Code deployment lead time , code deployment frequency , and time to resolve problems are predictive of software delivery , operational performance , and organizational performance , and they correlate with burnout , employee engagement , and so much more .
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
“ Isn’t it absurd that when you build a feature , changes sometimes have to be made by the UI team , the front - end team , the back - end team , and the database team ? ”
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
“ Build responsibility moved from
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
originally defined by Ward Cunningham in 2003 . He said , ‘ technical debt is what you feel the next time you want to make a change . ’
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
it usually refers to things we need to clean up , or where we need to create or restore simplicity , so that that we can quickly , confidently , and safely make changes to the system .
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
‘ complexity debt , ’ because they’re not just technical issues — they’re business issues .
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
First Ideal of Locality and Simplicity in our code and organizations .
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
engagement scores of the technology employees versus the rest of the business and ponder the differences , especially on the Phoenix Project . 
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
“ I’ve heard he’s been having many conversations with Bill Palmer , the new VP of IT Operations , ” Kirsten adds . “ Bill told me about how Erik is teaching him something called the Three Ways and the Four Types of Work . ”
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
“ There are Five Ideals , ”
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
First Ideal of Locality and Simplicity . We need to design things so that we have locality in our systems and the organizations that build them . And we need simplicity in everything we do . The last place we want complexity is internally , whether it’s in our
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
code , in our organization , or in our processes . The external world is complex enough , so it would be intolerable if we allow it in things we can actually control ! We must make it easy to do our work . ”
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
“ The Second Ideal is Focus , Flow , and Joy . It’s all about how our daily work feels .
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
The Third Ideal is Improvement of Daily Work . Reflect upon what the Toyota Andon
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
cord teaches us about how we must elevate improvement of daily work over daily work itself . The Fourth Ideal is Psychological Safety , where we make it safe to talk about problems , because solving problems requires prevention , which requires honesty , and honesty requires the absence of fear . In manufacturing , psychological safety is just as important as physical safety . And finally , the Fifth Ideal is Customer Focus , where we ruthlessly question whether something actually matters to our customers , as in , are they willing to pay us for it or is it only of value to our functional silo ? ”
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
The First Ideal — Locality and Simplicity The Second Ideal — Focus , Flow , and Joy The Third Ideal — Improvement of Daily Work The Fourth Ideal — Psychological Safety The Fifth Ideal — Customer Focus
### Chapter 7: Thursday, September 18 ### 
all - too - popular prejudice that developers have about QA people , which embarrasses her . QA is often viewed as an underclass , but at least they’re above Ops . All of which is crap ,
## Part Two: September 23–November 9 ## 
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23 ### 
Data Hub is so easy . It’s one of the least glamorous technology areas in the company .
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2110Data Hub is a mishmash of technologies built up over the decades ,
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2126“ heisenbugs , ”
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2213This is not the famous Amazon ideal of the “ two - pizza team , ” where features can be created by individual teams that can be fed with two pizzas .
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2310“ He’s assigned Wes to screen all my emails and phone calls and to yell at anyone trying to get ahold of me . Life is fantastic ! Seriously , never better . ”
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2335Like the Phoenix Project , they became so encumbered by technical debt they could no longer deliver what their customers demanded , ”
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2338“ Technical debt is a fact of life , like deadlines . Business people understand deadlines , but often are completely oblivious that technical debt even exists . Technical debt is inherently neither good nor bad — it happens because in our daily work , we are always making trade - off decisions , ”
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2340“ To make the date , sometimes we take shortcuts , or skip writing our automated tests , or hard - code something for a very specific case ,
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2349Satya Nadella , CEO of Microsoft , still has a culture that if a developer ever has a choice between working on a feature or developer productivity , they should always choose developer productivity .
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2354Amazon likely spent over $ 1 billion over six years rearchitecting all their internal services to be decoupled from each other .
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2355By 2013 they were performing nearly 136,000 deployments per day .
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2357Nokia . When their market was disrupted by Apple and Android , they spent hundreds of millions of dollars hiring developers and investing in rolling out Agile . But they did so without realizing their real problem : technical debt in the form of an architecture where developers could not be productive . They lacked the conviction to rebuild the foundations of their software systems .
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2361When he learned that generating a Symbian build took a whole forty - eight hours , he said that it felt like someone hit him in the head with a sledgehammer , ”
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2367“ Business people can see features or apps , so getting funding for those is easy , ” he continues . “ But they don’t see the vast architectures underneath that support them , connecting systems , teams , and data to each other . And underneath that is something extraordinarily important : the systems that developers use in their daily work to be productive .
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2405the Third Ideal is Improvement of Daily Work . It is the dynamic that allows us to change and improve how we work , informed by learning .
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2408“ The famous Andon cord is just one of their many tools that enable learning . When anyone encounters a problem , everyone is expected to ask for help at any time , even if it means stopping the entire assembly line . And they are thanked for doing so , because it is an opportunity to improve daily work .
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2428Fourth Ideal of Psychological Safety . No one will take risks , experiment , or innovate in a culture of fear , where people are afraid to tell the boss bad
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2429news , ” Erik says , laughing . “ In those organizations , novelty is discouraged , and when problems occur , they ask ‘ Who caused the problem ? ’ They name , blame , and shame that person .
### Chapter 8: Tuesday, September 23### Position 2436As Sensei John Allspaw says , every incident is a learning opportunity , an unplanned investment that was made without our consent .
### Chapter 9: Monday, September 29### Position 2676Great QA people are notoriously good at breaking other people’s code .
### Chapter 9: Monday, September 29### Position 2685Maxine keeps thinking about how many of these great tests could be automated . It would liberate the QA teams from work that is tedious , time - consuming , and error - prone , and free up their genius to find more ways to break the code .
### Chapter 9: Monday, September 29### Position 2686Moreover , these automated tests would be run every time a developer checks in code , giving fast and immediate feedback that Maxine and other developers love .
### Chapter 10: Monday, September 29### Position 2792Maxine loves it when everyone merges their changes frequently to the ‘ master branch , ’ such as once per day . That way , the size of the changes being merged are never allowed to get too large . Small batch sizes , like in manufacturing , create a smooth flow of work , with no jarring disruptions or catastrophes .
### Chapter 10: Monday, September 29### Position 2810“ You know the joke — what’s the plural of ‘ developer ’ ? ” says Maxine . “ A ‘ merge conflict . ’ ”
### Chapter 10: Monday, September 29### Position 2830All the Dev managers are complaining about how much of a hassle this is . Some are lobbying to do these merges less frequently — instead of once per month , maybe once per quarter . ”
### Chapter 10: Monday, September 29### Position 2833“ If it hurts , do it less often .
### Chapter 10: Monday, September 29### Position 2834It hurts because the merge sizes are so large .
### Chapter 10: Monday, September 29### Position 2835To make it hurt less , they need to do it more frequently , so that the merges are small and create fewer conflicts . ”
### Chapter 11: Wednesday, October 1### Position 3059Maxine knows that the developers will eventually be responsible for testing their own code , with QA taking a more strategic role , coaching and consulting . It means all the automated tests they’re writing will soon run with every check - in once they get their centralized build and continuous integration ( CI ) server going .
### Chapter 11: Wednesday, October 1### Position 3174“ You build it , you run it . ”
### Chapter 11: Wednesday, October 1### Position 3177Some are just using the Docker images on their laptops , some are using environments in vagrant , Git , or terraform configurations , simulating both Dev and test environments .
### Chapter 11: Wednesday, October 1### Position 3183In fact , many of the QA teams are sitting side by side with developers each day .
### Chapter 11: Wednesday, October 1### Position 3200This is one of the great things about using Docker containers , Maxine thinks . Containers are immutable , unable to be changed after they’re created , so if it works in Dev , it will almost certainly work in Test .
### Chapter 11: Wednesday, October 1### Position 3202Immutability is another concept from functional programming that is making the world a more predictable and safer place ,
### Chapter 11: Wednesday, October 1### Position 3207“ Every developer knows that in the next interval , they need to write automated tests as they write the feature , not afterward .
### Chapter 11: Wednesday, October 1### Position 3227Erik would be proud , she thinks . This fast and frequent feedback is such a big part of achieving the Second Ideal of Focus , Flow , and Joy .
### Chapter 11: Wednesday, October 1### Position 3251She’s delighted that the team is organizing itself , just as Erik predicted .
### Chapter 12: Monday, October 13### Position 3254The constraint used to be getting environments —
### Chapter 12: Monday, October 13### Position 3255Then the constraint became testing , which started only when Development was finished with
### Chapter 12: Monday, October 13### Position 3257deployment —
### Chapter 12: Monday, October 13### Position 3278Promotions also needs to rapidly experiment and iterate to discover which bundles customers are actually interested in and what specific factors lead to an actual purchase .
### Chapter 12: Monday, October 13### Position 3279Right now , iterating only once every six weeks is not fast enough to learn and adapt — our e - commerce competitors are doing multiple experiments per day , ”
### Chapter 12: Monday, October 13### Position 3468“ Maggie and Sarah tell me that you’ve proposed to create your own Ops organization inside of Dev ? !
### Chapter 12: Monday, October 13### Position 3489how to do production operations without centralized Ops .
### Chapter 12: Monday, October 13### Position 3491The goal is clear : enable fast and safe deployments into production ,
### Chapter 12: Monday, October 13### Position 3491and for the first time in years , do it using the same environments across Dev , Test , and Production .
### Chapter 12: Monday, October 13### Position 3504loves — in infrastructure , almost everything you do has a side - effect that mutates the state of something in the environment , making it difficult to isolate and test changes , as well as diagnose problems when things go wrong .
### Chapter 12: Monday, October 13### Position 3552Instead of one product manager working on this the entire time , we could have had five people working on it . And we could have been learning the whole time ,
### Chapter 12: Monday, October 13### Position 3582Right now , I need product managers who are working side by side with the teams who are building what will achieve our most important business objectives .
### Chapter 12: Monday, October 13### Position 3586By mid - day Monday , that product owner moved his desk right next to Maxine . The dynamic immediately shifts . To get answers , things no longer wait on tickets . Engineers are able to just swivel their chairs around and ask him . Things that normally took days are being resolved in minutes . And better yet , engineers start gaining a much better understanding of the business domain .
### Chapter 13: Thursday, November 6 ### 
For the past two days , at the same time each day , as a test , they’ve been pushing “ whitespace changes ” into production — adding a couple of blank lines to the end of HTML
### Chapter 13: Thursday, November 6 ### 
or configuration files , which in theory should not change functionality in any way .
### Chapter 13: Thursday, November 6 ## 
They discovered that they accidentally forgot some critical files in their container images , which knocked Data Hub offline for nearly a half hour . Three hours later , after a painstaking investigation , they were able to execute the whitespace deployment without crashing anything .
### Chapter 13: Thursday, November 6 ### 
we found two other places where we missed some configuration settings in environment variables . Those are now all in version control .
### Chapter 13: Thursday, November 6 ### 
“ Data Hub is processing transactions again . We’re in the deployment business ! ”
### Chapter 13: Thursday, November 6 ### 
Our attempts to go through the normal channels haven’t worked , so here’s our chance to work directly with the business instead of through technology middle managers . If we succeed , we get credibility . We’d love your endorsement supporting these new ways of working . ”
### Chapter 13: Thursday, November 6 ### 
“ Every time we have an outage , we’ll be conducting a blameless post - mortem like this one . The spirit and intent of these sessions are to learn from them , chronicling what happened before memories fade . Prevention requires honesty , and honesty requires the absence of fear .
### Chapter 13: Thursday, November 6th### Position 3716like Norm Kerth says in the Agile Prime Directive , ‘ Regardless of what we discover , we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could , given what they knew at the time , their skills and abilities , the resources available , and the situation at hand . ’
### Chapter 13: Thursday, November 6th### Position 3750Maxine is certain that everyone has learned something about how Data Hub actually works , in stark contrast with their mental models of how they thought it works . She records a list of five things people will change right away that will likely prevent future outages and will certainly make fixing certain problems faster in the future .
### Chapter 13: Thursday, November 6th### Position 3753It was a pitch - perfect example of improving daily work and fostering a culture of psychological safety , as Erik described in the Third and Fourth Ideals .
### Chapter 13: Thursday, November 6th### Position 3805if we can’t experiment , we can’t learn ! ”
### Chapter 13: Thursday, November 6th### Position 3847Famously at Parts Unlimited , every leader at the director - level or higher must work in the stores as a front - line employee twice a year .
### Chapter 13: Thursday, November 6th### Position 3941“ In order to speak clearly , you need to be able to think clearly . And to think clearly , you usually need to be able to write it clearly . ”
### Chapter 13: Thursday, November 6th### Position 4008encounter challenges , including conflicting definitions of data across all the enterprise silos , tough choices about what database technologies would best support the Promotions effort , and lots of unanticipated problems now that they’re working directly with the data scientists and analysts .
## Part Three: November 10–Present ### 
### Chapter 14: Monday, November 10 ### 
The term “ unicorn ” is often used to reference high - flying tech startups and the FAANGs that Erik talked about — the Facebooks , Amazons , Apples , Netflixes , and Googles of the world . Parts Unlimited is a century - old horse , but they are out to prove that they can do everything the unicorns can , with the right culture , technical practices , and architectures to support them . In fact , what is a unicorn besides a horse with a horn and painted up with some fancy rainbow colors ?
### Chapter 14: Monday, November 10 ### 
She’s always loved the Tuckman phases of teams , going through form , storm , norm , and perform . She’s ready to start norming and performing !
### Chapter 14: Monday, November 10 ### 
And team names help create an identity for the entire group , not just for individuals , and they reinforce the notion that team goals are more important than individual goals .
### Chapter 14: Monday, November 10 ### 
Among them was the thirty - day feature freeze . Everyone in technology worked on fixing problems and paying down technical debt .
### Chapter 14: Monday, November 10 ### 
‘ technical debt ’ is what creates hardship , toil , and reduces the agility of our software engineers , ”
### Chapter 14: Monday, November 10 ### 
whenever you have a team of people who are passionately committed to achieving a mission and who have the right skills and abilities , it’s dangerous to bet against them , because they’ll move heaven and earth to make it happen .
### Chapter 14: Monday, November 10 ### 
She is proposing to build a Spark - like big data and compute platform , fed by an entirely new event - streaming bus , modeled closely to what the tech giants all have built to solve their data problems at scale . It would allow hundreds , even thousands , of CPU cores to be thrown at the computations , allowing analyses that currently take days or weeks to be done in minutes or hours .
### Chapter 14: Monday, November 10 ### 
This led to the invention of Hadoop , Spark , Beam , and so many other exciting technologies that transformed this space , just like NoSQL revolutionized the database landscape .
### Chapter 14: Monday, November 10 ### 
“ Unlike Data Hub , where almost every business rule change also requires a change from the Data Hub team , this new scheme would allow a massive decoupling of services and data .
### Chapter 14: Monday, November 10 ### 
They defer the event streaming platform , but Maxine and Shannon will lead the creation of something that can provide more bulletproof data transformations , get things under version control , build automated testing to confirm the correct shape and size of data before it’s ingested , and so many other things to prevent all these data accidents she’s seen and heard about .
### Chapter 14: Monday, November 10 ### 
Seeing and spreading learnings , as per Erik’s Third Ideal , Improvement of Daily Work .
### Chapter 15: Tuesday, November 25 ### 
When everyone knows what the goals are , as Erik predicted ,
### Chapter 15: Tuesday, November 25 ### 
teams will self - organize to best achieve those goals .
### Chapter 15: Tuesday, November 25 ### 
People across different disciplines — Dev , QA , Ops , Security , and now even Data and Analytics — are working together daily as fellow teammates instead of adversaries .
### Chapter 15: Tuesday, November 25 ### 
code is now being promoted into production multiple times per day , smoothly , quickly , and mostly without incident , with any issues being resolved quickly and without blame or undue crisis .
### Chapter 15: Tuesday, November 25 ### 
Left to their own devices , development teams will often optimize everything around themselves . This is just the parochial and selfish nature of individual teams . And that’s why you need architects ,
### Chapter 15: Tuesday, November 25 ### 
he’s handled more outages than everyone else in the room combined . Having that type of experience during this high - stakes launch is a very good thing . We developers are great at what we do , but these types of crises are a part of everyday life for Ops .
### Chapter 15: Tuesday, November 25 ### 
Sarah’s beliefs are like the antithesis of the Third Ideal of Improvement of Daily Work and the Fourth Ideal of Psychological Safety . Maxine knows that the only way they could have achieved what they had was by creating a culture where people felt safe to experiment , to learn and make mistakes , and where people make time for discovery , innovation , and learning .
### Chapter 15: Tuesday, November 25 ### 
“ The Fifth Ideal is about a ruthless Customer Focus , where you are truly striving for what is best for them , instead of the more parochial goals that they don’t care about , whether it’s your internal plans of record or how your functional silos are measured , ”
### Chapter 15: Tuesday, November 25 ### 
“ Instead we ask whether our daily actions truly improve the lives of our customer , create value for them , and whether they’d pay for it . And if they don’t , maybe we shouldn’t be doing it at all . ”
### Chapter 16: Friday, December 5 ### 
“ Horizon 1 is your successful , cash - cow businesses , where the customer , business , and operational models are well - known and predictable .
### Chapter 16: Friday, December 5 ### 
Horizon 2 lines of business are so important , because they represent the future of the company . They may introduce the company’s capabilities to new customers , adjacent markets , or with different business models . These endeavors may not be profitable , but this is where we find higher - growth areas .
### Chapter 16: Friday, December 5 ### 
Horizon 3 , where the focus is on velocity of learning and having a broad pool of ideas to explore , ” he says . “ Here , the name of the game is to prototype ideas and to answer as quickly as possible the three questions of market risk , technical risk , and business model risk : Does the idea solve a real customer need ? Is it technically feasible ? And is there a financially feasible engine of growth ? If the answer is no to any of them , it’s time to pivot or kill the idea .
### Chapter 16: Friday, December 5 ### 
“ If the answer is yes , then the idea is continually developed until it earns the right to graduate to Horizon 2 , where
### Chapter 16: Friday, December 5 ### 
the business builders take over , ” he says , pausing for a moment . “ Your obvious problem is that you have virtually no Horizon 2 businesses , and absolutely no Horizon 3 .
### Chapter 16: Friday, December 5 ### 
in Horizon 3 , you must go fast , you must be constantly experimenting , and you must be allowed to break all the rules and processes governing Horizon 1 , ”
### Chapter 16: Friday, December 5 ### 
it’s about fast iteration , making lots of bets , and doubling down on the winners until they graduate to become Horizon 2 businesses . This is where the new methods are forged and mastered , which will likely help the organization survive into the next century .
### Chapter 16: Friday, December 5 ### 
If you’re first to market , you will capture fifty percent of the revenue that the entire product category will ever yield . Second place will capture twenty - five percent , and third place will get fifteen percent . For any later entrants , it will surely have been a complete waste of time and money .
### Chapter 16: Friday, December 5 ### 
“ Speed matters . Or more precisely , lead time from idea to market offering matters , ”
### Chapter 16: Friday, December 5 ### 
There is an instinct to maximize profitability and take cash out of the business instead of reinvesting it . This is the ‘ manage to value ’ thesis and is the opposite of ‘ manage to growth . ’
### Chapter 16: Friday, December 5 ### 
psychological safety is as much of a precondition to dynamic , learning organizations as physical safety ? ”
### Chapter 17: Friday, December 12 ### 
the Hoare principle : “ There are two ways to write code : write code so simple there are obviously no bugs in it , or write code so complex that there are no obvious bugs in it . ”
### Chapter 17: Friday, December 12 ### 
the famous Google Map / Reduce paper
### Chapter 17: Friday, December 12 ### 
I mentioned Sensei Geoffrey Moore’s Three Horizons , but I didn’t have time to explain his concept of Core versus Context , which are what the Four Zones are about , ”
