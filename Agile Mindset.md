# Agile Mindset #

- Clarity of Requirements and Familiarity with Technology drive the "Uncertainty Level" of projects (-> Cynefin)
  - Cone of Uncertainty
  - Cynefin

- Traditional Approach
  Requirements -> Architecture -> Programming -> Testing -> Fixing
  - assumes correct requirements are known from the start
  - change is risky and costly, so new needs cannot be met
  - hand-offs between groups require work and invite disconnects
  - testing is done towards the end, when fixing defects is more expensive
  - no working software until late in the project => lots of surprises

- Iterations = Repeated Cycles of creating increments
  
- Change Requests - why do they exist?
  - end user is not clear about end result
  - assumptions differ
  - lack of clarity within development team
  - market changes
  - customer expectations change

- Agile vs. Waterfall
  - Predictive Process (Waterfall) = Plan-driven
    - too many things are done which are not directly related to software production (bringing value to the customer)
    - difficulty with incomplete or changing requirements
  - Adaptive Process (Agile) = Value-Driven
    - lightweight process
    - people-based rather than plan-based
    - several Agile methods, XP and Scrum being the most popular
    - no single definition, the Agile Manifesto comes closest

- **Responding to change** over following a plan
  

## SCRUM & SCRUM Events ##
- Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism
- three main pilars: transparency, inspection, and adaption

- Scrum projects make progress in a series of iterations, called **sprints**

**Roles**
- Product Owner
  - defines the features of the product
  - decides on the release date and content
  - responsible for the productivity of the product (ROI)
  - prioritizes features according to market value
  - adjusts features and prorities for every iteration, if needed
  - accepts or rejects work results
- 
- Scrum Master
  - servant leader of the team
  - leader, mentor, and coach of Scrum

  - stakeholder and communication management
  - continuous improvement (inspect and adapt)
  - process improvement at the systemic level, share best practices, knowledge management
  - improve team velocity/productivity by enabling the team to continuously improve

  - tracking and monitoring of sprint(s)
  - sharing best practices between teams
  - process improvements at sprint level and organizational level
  - pay special attention to distributed teams

- Scrum Team
  - Scrum Team consists of Development Team, Product Owner and Scrum Master
  - a self-organized team is key to the project success

- Development Team


**Ceremonies or Events**
- Sprint Planning
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective
- Daily Scrum Meeting

**Artifacts**
- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Burndown Charts
