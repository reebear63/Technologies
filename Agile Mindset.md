# Agile Mindset #

- Clarity of Requirements and Familiarity with Technology drive the "Uncertainty Level" of projects (-> Cynefin)
  - Cone of Uncertainty
  - Cynefin

- Traditional Approach
  Requirements -> Architecture -> Programming -> Testing -> Fixing
  - assumes correct requirements are known from the start
  - change is risky and costly, so new needs cannot be met
  - hand-offs between groups require work and invite disconnects
  - testing is done towards the end, when fixing defects is more expensive
  - no working software until late in the project => lots of surprises

- Iterations = Repeated Cycles of creating increments
  
- Change Requests - why do they exist?
  - end user is not clear about end result
  - assumptions differ
  - lack of clarity within development team
  - market changes
  - customer expectations change

- Agile vs. Waterfall
  - Predictive Process (Waterfall) = Plan-driven
  - Adaptive Process (Agile) = Value Driven
