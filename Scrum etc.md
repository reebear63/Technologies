## INVEST ##
The acronym INVEST helps to remember a widely accepted set of criteria, or checklist, to assess the 
quality of a user story. If the story fails to meet one of these criteria, the team may want to 
reword it, or even consider a rewrite (which often translates into physically tearing up the 
old story card and writing a new one).

A good user story should be:
“I” ndependent (of all others)
“N” egotiable (not a specific contract for features)
“V” aluable (or vertical)
“E” stimable (to a good approximation)
“S” mall (so as to fit within an iteration)
“T” estable (in principle, even if there isn’t a test for it yet)

Origins
* 2003: the INVEST checklist for quickly evaluating user stories originates in an article by 
  Bill Wake, which also repurposed the acronym SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
  Time-boxed) for tasks resulting from the technical decomposition of user stories.
* 2004: the INVEST acronym is among the techniques recommended in Mike Cohn’s “User Stories applied“, 
  which discusses it at length in Chapter 2.
