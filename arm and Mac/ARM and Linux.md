# ARM and Linux #

Linux on ARM is not a really new thing, since Android and Raspian OS are based on Linux. The same applies for Apple mobile devices as even the first iPod was based on an ARM processor (Apple's history with ARM goes back to the very early 1990s when they selected ARM processors for their Newton which led them to buy a 43% stake in Acorn RISC Machines, which was renamed to Advanced RISC machines to avoid the Acorn nametag).

Apple's transition from Intel CPUs to their own chips creates some momentum in the area of Linux-based laptops. 

On November 14, Linus Torvalds of Linux fame commented the Apple M1 laptops: 
"I'd love to have one, if it just ran Linux.. I have fairly fond memories of the 11" Macbook Air (I think 4,1) that I used about a decade ago (but moved away from because it took Apple too long to fix the screen - and by the time they did, I'd moved on to better laptops, and Apple had moved on to make Linux less convenient).
Apple may run Linux in their cloud, but their laptops don't ;( 
I've been waiting for an ARM laptop that can run Linux for a <i>long</i> time. The new Air would be almost perfect, except for the OS. And I don't have the time to tinker with it, or the inclination to fight companies that don't want to help."

Nevertheless, Apple either is not or will not be the only company providing ARM-based laptops of a certain build quality.
